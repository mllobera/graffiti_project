    "The real power of Python comes from the fact that you can extend its functionality through *modules* and *packages*:\n",
    "* A **Module** is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables (appears as a file with a .py extension) file.\n",
    "* A **Package** is a directory or folder that typically contains a collection of modules (in addition to modules, the directory or folder will  contain a `__init__.py` file which is how Python identifies it as a package. A package may also contains sub-packages inside it.   \n",

    "Usually *Modules* and *packages* need to be downloaded and installed before we can actually use them. If you are following this book using *jupyterhub* as in this course, this is not something you need to worry about right now. Once a package has been successfully downloaded and installed, we need to bring it into our environment, or **import** it, to be able to start using it. There are several ways of doing this. Here we will show you what are the best way of doing this.\n",
