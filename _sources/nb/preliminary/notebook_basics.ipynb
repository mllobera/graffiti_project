    "As part of learning the different ways in which we can use Python we will be using the *Jupyter Notebook* environment (henceforth *notebooks*). Notebooks are great environments to explore data and learn data science coding. It allows the easy combination of text, graphics and code. You will be able to write code and immediately see the results after you execute it. A notebook is typically made out of *cells*. You can think of a *cell* as a paragraph in a text. Typically, these cells contain either bits of code or text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the are different softwares you can use to write and run a notebook. Some of the most common are: [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All of these require that you install them on your own compute before you can write and run a notebook. In this course we will use JupyterHub which allow us to run Jupyter notebooks on the cloud (another resource is Google's Colaboratory or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0)) instead. The advantage of using this resource is that you can write and run notebooks from any browser without the need to install anything on your own computer. You will also be able to save all your work directly on your cloud space.\n"
