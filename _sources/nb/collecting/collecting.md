# Collecting Data
*by Alec Iacobucci*   
\
Part of the *Epicollect5* form that you will be using to collect data will ask you to take photos of the instances of graffiti and the canvas, or backdrop, and the general surroundings in which it is found. It is important that these photos are taken in a particular way, as this will maximize their utility in analyzing the data within the project.

```{hint}
 If you know, it might be very useful to turn the grid lines on on your camera app!
```
## Three Kinds of Photo

The *Epicollect5* form will ask you to take three different kinds of photo:
- two photos for each canvas
- one photo for each graffito that you register in the database. 

```{caution}
To enter a graffiti entry **you require one canvas entry** but you may have more that one graffiti entry per a single canvas entry. 
```
```{danger}
Do not confuse a canvas entry with a graffiti entry. To have a graffiti entry you need a canvas entry!!
```

### Photo 1: Canvas and Surroundings
The first photo asks you to take a picture of the canvas in its surrounding environment while keeping the canvas in the photo. Here are some examples,

:width: 500px
```

```

### Photo 2: The Canvas

The second photo still asks you to focus on the area in which you find the graffiti, however this time the goal is to capture the entire canvas; i.e. the entire panel on which you find graffiti. It could be a mailbox, a street sign, even an entire building facade. Do your best to capture the image as perpendicularly as you can from the image.

```

```


### Photo 3: The Graffito
Once you have collected information about ***where*** your graffiti is found; i.e. your **canvas**,  you are now ready to enter information about any graffiti that might be on this canvas (it might just be one or many). You should enter information about a single graffiti instance or *graffito*. Among this, should be a photo where the *entire* graffito occupies the entire frame. Inasmuch as you can, take the photo so that your camera direction is perpendicular to the canvas (you are parallel to the canvas). Avoid taking photos at an angle.

```
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-4.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-5.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-6.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```

## What to avoid

Bad photos of graffiti are practically useless. To avoid *bad* photos, remember to keep your camera direction as perpendicular as possible from the canvas. The grid lines on your camera will help you to keep your horizontal and vertical lines straight!

Here are some 'not so good' examples,

### Not so 'useful' canvas pics

The angle here of the photo is off. The direction of the photo was not perpendicular to the wall working as a canvas.
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-7.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```
Another example of wrong angle,
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-11.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```

Photo taken too far away.

```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-12.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```
Next, the direction of the photo was not perpendicular to the dumpster working as a canvas.
```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-15.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```

### Not so 'useful' graffiti pics

Make sure the entire canvas or graffito is in your frame! You do not want your image cut off by the edges of your photo! Make sure the photo is in focus!

What is the intent of the following photo? As a canvas photo is not very good and neither as a graffito one as the graffito does not occupy the entire frame.

```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-13.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```

This photo is somewhat out of focus and incomplete. It cuts part of the graffito.

```{image} ../../images/collecting/graffiti-project-14.png
:align: center
:width: 500px
```

Out of focus.
