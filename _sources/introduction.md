# Graffiti Project 
**COMBINING URBAN LANDSCAPE ARCHAEOLOGY AND DATA SCIENCE** 

*Course designed and taught by [Marcos Llobera](https://www.digarlab.uw.edu/llobera) (with contributions by [Alec Iacobucci](https://www.digarlab.uw.edu/copy-of-profile-template))*

This book is meant to be a companion to the UW Archaeology course (ARCHY 5/235) *Exploring Graffiti*. You should consider this a 'live' book, meaning that its contents are likely to constantly evolve and change.

### Exploring Graffiti course

This course is part of a campus wide initiative aimed at introducing *basic* computational and data science skills to students who, traditionally, would not have had much exposure to these.

**Archaeology concerns itself with understanding the relationships between people and the material world that surrounds them.** In this particular case, we are interested in using data science tools to learn something about the world of graffiti that surrounds you. 

This course is not a Computer Science or programming course. **While It is not expected you will come with any programming skills**. It is expected that you are interested in learning how to write basic code aimed at exploring graffiti data that you and your peers will be collecting throughout the course. 

This book provides some background on the Graffiti project, guidelines on how data should be collected and an framework for the information covered in the class. Much of the material included in this book is covered in more detail in class while other is included as background information. 

```{caution}
While hopefully useful, do not consider this book to be a substitute for what we will be covered in the classroom.

### Python 
Throughout this course we will be learning how to use Python to process and visualize Graffiti data . Python is a computer language all on its own but it is also considered one of the ***premier*** computer languages used to conduct data science (another one is *R*). Python as been adopted by the scientific community at large and it is constantly growing. You can use Python for data science, as we will in this course, but you can also use it many other scientific fields.

While this is not a Python programming course *per se*, you will be learning a lot about Python. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with many basic data science techniques regardless of your ultimate field of interest.
